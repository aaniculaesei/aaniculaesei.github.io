## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Formal Methods Unit at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of software engineering and formal methods for dependable autonomous and AI-enabled systems, with applications to safety-critical domains. I develop methods that combine design-time formal verification, model-based testing, and runtime assurance to improve the reliability and robustness of complex autonomous safety-critical systems.

In my [doctoral work (PhD thesis)](https://doi.org/10.21268/20250509-0), I introduced a methodology for engineering safety in automated safety-critical systems through the explicit specification, design-time verification, and runtime validation of environment assumptions, integrated seamlessly into the software development lifecycle.
