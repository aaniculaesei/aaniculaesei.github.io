## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Formal Methods Unit at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology.

My research lies at the intersection of software engineering and formal methods for dependable autonomous and AI-enabled systems, with applications to safety-critical domains. I develop methods that combine design-time formal verification, model-based testing, and runtime assurance to improve the reliability and robustness of complex autonomous safety-critical systems.

In my [doctoral work (PhD thesis)](https://doi.org/10.21268/20250509-0), I introduced a methodology for engineering safety in automated safety-critical systems through the explicit specification, design-time verification, and runtime validation of environment assumptions, integrated seamlessly into the software development lifecycle.

### Previous Projects

**Methods for the ODD Specification (2022-2024)**
Design of an YAML-based ODD specification language and automated ODD-consistency checking with SMT solvers.

**LogiSmile: Last mile logistics for autonomous goods delivery (2022-2024)**
Design and development of an integrated autonomous delivery system for the delivery of goods in urban
areas, consisting of an automated hub vehicle acting as a mobile depot for an autonomous delivery
robot, which picks up packages from the mobile depot and delivers them to the end customers.

**Mobil-e-Hub (2020-2023)**
Development of a solution for the last-mile delivery, by combining autonomous
drones carrying transport boxes via carrier systems to (electric) vehicles - the mobile e-hubs - for
passenger mobility, e.g., public transport buses or car-sharing vehicles.

**VanAssist (2019-2021)**
Development of offboard and onboard runtime monitoring systems for automated delivery vehicles operating on company premises and in urban environments, for the purpose of automated delivery of goods in urban centers.

**Automated Test Case Generation 1.0 & 2.0 (2018-2021)**
Automated generation of executable test cases from formalized system requirements using model checking, including the extension of the test case generation concept to be integrated with the ANSYS SCADE development environment.

**Formal Verification of Exhaust Gas After-Treatment Function (2019-2020)**
Formal verification
of the vehicle function responsible for exhaust gas after-treatment with respect to expert-defined requirements and sensor error and tolerance models.

**Verification of the Speed Estimation Function (2018-2019)**
Formal verification of automotive functions for speed estimation against NCAP and legal requirements. Construction of mathematical proofs and tolerance analyses based on abstract algorithmic models of the automotive function; derivation of application parameters ensuring compliance; and generation of test cases from formal models
